## Rating System

I encourage anyone who has gone through a resource that has a 'Rating Pending' and wants to
contribute, to add a `Comment` and a `Rating` via a Pull Request. The system is quite relaxed and
subjective. Good, great or awesome depending on how you feel about the specific resource. If the
resource is not even "good" then it should not be on this list. Pull Requests to change a `Rating`
or a `Comment` are also welcome. 

☆☆☆ - Rating Pending (Nobody in the community has read, used or analysed the resource so review is pending.)\
★☆☆ - Good\
★★☆ - Great\
★★★ - Awesome
